        <p>Sapphire Golden Retrievers is dedicated to producing a quality line of Golden Retrievers. All of our litters come from sires and dams that have their hips registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and are free from genetic hip disease. Their eyes are certified by an ophthalmologist, clearing them of any inherited eye disease. They have their hearts certified by a cardiologist, screening for any abnormalities and cleared of cardiovascular disease. We only breed dogs with all of these certifications. Our dogs are free of allergies, epilepsy, and of course must display the true Golden Retriever temperament.</p>
        <p>Our litters are born in our home and begin socializing with our family at an early age until they come into your home. All of the Sapphire Golden Retriever puppies have complete and thorough examinations by our veterinarian at the age of 6 weeks old and are guaranteed to be in good, clean state of health on departure from our home. We do not sell our dogs for breeding purposes. Pets are to be spayed/neutered before reaching reproductive maturity. </p>
        <p>During the life of this dog if for any reason you can not keep it, the breeder has first right of refusal.</p>
